## Hardwares used
1. üì∂ Modem/router (for internet connection)
2. üñ•Ô∏è Raspberry Pi 3B (use at least 16 GB MicroSD to be safe)
3. üì∑ ESP32-CAM (with FTDI or downloader module)
4. üìü LCD (with I2C PCF8574 module)
5. ‚öñÔ∏è Load cell 10 KG (with HX711 module)
6. üîä Piezo buzzer

## Softwares used
1. Raspberry Pi OS (full desktop + software)
2. Visual Studio Code (or any text editor)
3. TensorFlow Lite (ARM32 version)
4. Arduino IDE (for ESP32-CAM)
5. Python (tested on v3.9.9)

See more detail on instructions...

## Technical instructions

### Setting-up ESP32-CAM for capturing images ([ref](https://randomnerdtutorials.com/esp32-cam-video-streaming-face-recognition-arduino-ide))
1. Install Arduino IDE on your PC (preferred) or Raspberry Pi
2. Install ESP32 (ESP32-CAM) add-on on Arduino IDE
3. Plug (to PC/RPi), flash, and run ESP32-CAM C++ code using Arduino IDE
4. Save ESP32-CAM camera server IP address by any means
5. Unplug ESP32-CAM (if plugged to PC) and plug it to Raspberry Pi - Power and Ground only 
5. Capture food images (the more the better) of at least 2 food types (use different angles/rotations, etc.)
6. Save the images for later (machine learning training purpose)

### Setting-up Python libraries and machine learning
1. Install Python libraries using `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Install [TFLite runtime](https://www.tensorflow.org/lite/guide/python) (I use the one from [GitHub releases](https://github.com/google-coral/pycoral/releases/))
3. Train your ML model using the captured food images, use [Teachable Machine](https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/) (preferred) or [EdgeImpulse](https://studio.edgeimpulse.com/)
4. Change the class name of each food type with the food name (as close as possible to [FatSecret](https://www.fatsecret.com/calories-nutrition/) food name)
5. Export your model as `.tflite` file and save it for later use

### Setting-up FatSecret REST API ([ref](https://platform.fatsecret.com/api/Default.aspx?screen=rapih))
1. Register an application [here](https://platform.fatsecret.com/api/Default.aspx?screen=r). Don't register it as web application unless you want to use JavaScript API
2. After registration complete, save your `client_id` and `client_secret` (treat them like username and password)
3. Add your internet IP (not your local IP) to FatSecret `Allowed IP Addresses` (on FatSecret web settings)
4. You should be able to make REST API calls now ([ref](https://platform.fatsecret.com/api/Default.aspx?screen=rapiref2))

## Use instructions
1. Make sure you complete all steps in technical instructions
2. Clone this repo code using `git clone` (non-collaborator) or `git remote add` (collaborator)
3. Read the code and make some changes if needed (including `client_id`, `client_secret`, GPIO pin, ESP32-CAM IP address, etc.)
4. ???
5. Profit

## Todo
* Push daily calorie statistics to NodeRED (from CSV file)
* Prevent food stats logging when the image classification accuracy is bad
